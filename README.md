# Assignments of Linux Kernel Programming

No course code here so I don't feel bad. :P

This repository marked my journey of learning Linux Kernel Programming (in a course, I'm too lazy to read the actual book. Help :( ).

Either way, this repository is a collection of assignments I've done in the course. Some of which actually compiles into the Linux Kernel. Try it and you might crash your kernel :P. Magic.
